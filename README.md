## ReadmeGenerator
    
### What is this? 🤔 
This project is a README generator for Github Projects, as I was a litte tired of needing to manually edit them everytime and I want to make a standart for my READMES.

This README was generated using it! However, it is still under development, and new features are expected soon, such as support for more languages and images upload.
